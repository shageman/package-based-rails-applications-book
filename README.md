# Source Code to _Package-Based Rails Applications_ by Stephan Hagemann

This repository holds the source code used in my book on Package-based Rails Applications.

It is organized by chapter and section encoded as _cXs0Y_ for "Chapter X, Section Y." If a section adds no code that is
specific to it, it may use the source code from the last section preceding it that does have source code samples attached.

Because the Ruby and Rails ecosystems are moving so rapidly, creating a book about high-level structural concepts is
tough when underlying libraries constantly require subtle changes to the sample code. To this end, all source code packages its gem dependencies.

## Development

The `docker` and `generator_scripts` folders are for development of the chapter samples. In fact, all of the samples
were generated via script in a concourse pipeline. I.e., every transformation described in a chapter
can be executed via the shell script belonging to that chapter.

*These instructions assume that you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) running on OSX.*

### Starting Concourse and Minio on Docker

[Concourse](https://github.com/concourse/concourse) acts as our CI server, which will run the pipeline.
[Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio) is our local S3 compatible serverm, which will hold the outputs of the pipeline.

In one terminal execute the following to install the needed docker containers.
~~~~~~~~
docker-compose up -d
~~~~~~~~

The services should be running at these locations:

* Concourse: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
* Minio: [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

If any of the containers fail to start, please check the docs of the docker images used for updates to their respective config:

* [concourse docker](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-docker)
* [minio docker](https://github.com/minio/minio)

### Get the Pipeline Running

Concourse gets configured via its [fly CLI](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html). Download it [here](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html). Or on Mac with brew installed via `brew cask install fly`.

To point fly at the locally running instance of concourse, first do this (and follow the instructions on screen). The above concourse installation gave you a user `test` with password `test`.
~~~~~~~~
fly --target local login --team-name main --concourse-url http://localhost:8080
~~~~~~~~

Then, to configure and start the pipeline
~~~~~~~~
fly -t local set-pipeline -p pipeline -c pipeline.yml --load-vars-from  pipeline-secrets.yml
fly -t local unpause-pipeline -p pipeline
fly -t local trigger-job -j pipeline/c2s01
~~~~~~~~

Now, navigating to [http://localhost:8080/teams/main/pipelines/pbra_full](http://localhost:8080/teams/main/pipelines/pbra_full) will show the running pipeline.

The output of the pipeline is *all* of the versions of the Sportsball codebase discussed in the book. Specifically, the output is a series of zip files in `./docker/minio/data/releases` - one zip file for each chapter / step of the pipeline.

### Updating the version of Rails to run against

The folder `code/docker/minio/data/releases` contains a couple of files named `app_XYZ.tgz`. These are archives of empty starter apps. These are empty Rails apps with just a few gems added (generated by `code/generator_scripts/ci/generate-code.sh`). For the rest of the pipeline, this locks down the dependencies that will be used for the generation of the chapter code.

You can manually start the `generate-empty-app` concourse step to generate an empty app with the current version of Rails and the other dependencies of the app.

Every run of the chapter-generation pipeline will use the latest version of Rails found in this folder. If you happen to delete all of the app archives, the chapter-generation pipeline will not work. In that case, either generate a new empty app or reset to the state of this repo to get the pipeline running again.

### Issues

If your pipelines don't work after a docker shutdown, try `fly prune-worker`.

If things are still broken, repeat the above steps after doing this (*careful*: this will wipe out all of the docker images and their disks running on your machine):
~~~~~~~~
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)     # Stop all running containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)     # Delete all containers
docker rmi $(docker images -q)   # Delete all images
docker volume prune
docker system prune -a
~~~~~~~~

What goes wrong?

* concourse can't find `generator_scripts` anymore (errors with "no such file"). Definitely do the above
* nothing works reliably anymore. Reinstall docker.


### Speeding up the pipeline

Some recent issues with concourse-docker have forced me to rerun the code build pipeline from the very start a lot. If there are changes to the steps at the tail of the pipeline only, the following calls speed up the time to get there:

```
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c2s01-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c2s02-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c2s03-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c2s04-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c2s05-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c2s06-test

fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c4s01-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c4s02-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c4s03-test

fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c5s07-1-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c5s07-2-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c5s07-3-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c5s08-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c5s09-test

fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c6s01-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c6s02-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c6s03-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c6s04-1-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c6s04-2a-test
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c6s04-2b-test



fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c4s01
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c4s02
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c5s08
fly pause-job -t local -j pipeline/c6s04-1
```
