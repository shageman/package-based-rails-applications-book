# This spec was generated by rspec-rails when you ran the scaffold generator.
# It demonstrates how one might use RSpec to test the controller code that
# was generated by Rails when you ran the scaffold generator.
#
# It assumes that the implementation code is generated by the rails scaffold
# generator. If you are using any extension libraries to generate different
# controller code, this generated spec may or may not pass.
#
# It only uses APIs available in rails and/or rspec-rails. There are a number
# of tools you can use to make these specs even more expressive, but we"re
# sticking to rails and rspec-rails APIs to keep things simple and stable.
